### 🚓 Rules for practice assessment

- See `WEEK_3&6_RULES.md`

## 🗒️ Grade

You final grade will be the combination of the following:

- The grade of the passing assessment (Passing grade: 45 / 60 points)
- **Interview** (soft skill evaluation) that will be taken place after the assessment
- Your success in prior assessments
- Your overall performance in the course

## 🎯 Learning goals

For transparency and clarity, these are the learning goals we will be testing:

### **Frontend**

- Basic knowledge of React
  - Components
  - Props
  - `useState`
  - `useEffect`
- Routing
  - Creating "pages"
  - Dynamic routing using react-router-dom
- Redux
  - Dispatching actions from your components to
  - Making a reducers that transform the redux state
  - Using selectors get state from the redux store and use it in your components
  - Separating reducers & actions & selectors
  - Using async actions (redux thunk)
- Fetching Data
  - Sending GET / POST / PATCH and DELETE requests using axios
  - Setting an authorization header with a JWT to make an authorized request

### **Backend**

- Using a database
  - Connecting to a remote DB like an ElephantSQL instance
- Setting up a server
  - Generating models & migrations using sequelize-cli
  - Doing database validation using sequelize models (e.g. allowNull: false, unique: true)
  - Implementing hasMany, hasOne and belongsTo relations
  - Adding foreign keys to models in migrations
  - Adding relations to sequelize models
  - Generating seed data using sequelize-cli
- Creating endpoints (routes)
  - Separating routes using the express Router
  - Implementing GET / POST / PATCH / DELETE routes in express
  - Creating, updating & deleting records from the database using sequelize models
  - Using the auth middleware to manage authorization for routes in express
- Querying the database
  - Using sequelize models
  - Eager loading related models using sequelize `include`
- Handling responses
  - Sending responses with express
  - Setting status codes to responses in express

If this sounds like a lot, it is!

it's because **you've learned a tremendous amount of things** these past weeks! Don't let it scare or overwhelm you though, you have seen it all!

## 💰 Tips

- Don't hesitate to use the reader, Google (Stackoverflow), or the documentation links we provide below.
- **Read the assignment carefully!** It is easy to accidentally deviate from an assignment, resulting in a frustrating homework experience. Taking the time to read the exercise can save you time and effort.
- **Don't get stuck!** If you feel stuck, try taking a small walk, continuing on to a next step, or talking out loud about the problem you're facing (programmers call this "rubber-ducking"). Everybody can get stuck, but don't let it stop you.

## 🔀 GIT

- Commit your code often and add meaningful messages (not just "changes added" but what you actually changed, shortly: "added cards to present artworks.")
- 🔴🔴🔴 You will **BE EXPECTED** to make at least 1 commit per feature! 🔴🔴🔴

✅ Once you done reading this overview, you can move on! no need to read this again.
